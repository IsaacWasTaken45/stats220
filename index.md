# **Here is the meme I came up with**

![](test_meme.png)

I am confident in the uniqueness of my meme because;
- I found the bottom right image from searching "Shocked Face" in google image
- I changed the text multiple different times while coming up with it
- I doubt other students would've resized the second image as messily as I did (I couldn't think of how else to do it then trial and error hard coding it)
